 Create a free tier service instance, spark, is large enough to handle WordPress. So to create the service instance:
	$ cf create-service cleardb spark wordpress-db
	Creating service wordpress-db in org quinn / space development as [email removed]...
	OK

Obtain the service credentials, go into the PWS console, select the space -> services, then click “Manage”.

This opens a new window/tab and passes your credentials to cleardb. Once the page loads, click on the database name.
	Then select the Endpoint Information for the desired instance.

All the parameters that is need are all here, so simply leave the tab open to copy and paste. In particular, the parameters of interest are:

* db name	
* db user	
* db password	
* hostname
